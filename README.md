### Project Overview
The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of an introduction to proof course on attitudes toward mathematical proof. This includes:

- Examining how these attitudes are influenced by pre-university education.
- Investigating how attitudes change among undergraduate students before and after taking the course.
- Analysing the differences in attitudes between standard and direct entry students.
- Identifying specific factors that may influence these attitudes.
